You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

When(/^the user enters email$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When(/^the user enters password$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then(/^the user should see a failed message$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
